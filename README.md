Fastfood is a simple way to share [lanes](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) between multiple projects.

## Features

- Syncing with remote `Fastfile`s
- Different `Fastfile` versions via tags and branches
- `Fastfile` import updating in projects

## Requirements

- masOS 10.10+
- Xcode 9.0+

## Usage

Fastfood is useful if you have shared lanes across multiple projects and you want to store the Fastfile in a remote git repository with local caching.
To use it run `fastfood update` in a project folder. That's all! Fastfood updates local saved `Fastfile`s if needed and creates a new `Fastfile` in current project or updates an existing file. By default Fastfood clones files from [this](https://github.com/rosberry/RSBFastlane) repo.

Run `fastfood help` to see available options:

```bash
Usage: fastfood update [options]
  -u, --url:
      URL to a repo contains Fastfile.
  -v, --version:
      A tag or branch name.
  -f, --force:
      Update to last version.
  --no-cache:
      Update shared fastlane ignoring cached versions. Usually uses for fastlane in development stage.
```
## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended):
```bash
$ brew install artemnovichkov/projects/fastfood
