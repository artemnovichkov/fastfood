Fastfood is a simple way to share [lanes](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) between multiple projects.

## Features

- Syncing with remote `Fastfile`s
- Different `Fastfile` versions via tags
- `Fastfile` import updating in projects

## Requirements

- masOS 10.10+
- Xcode 9.0+

## Usage

Fastfood is useful if you have shared lanes across multiple projects and you want to store the Fastfile in a remote git repository with local saving.
To use it run `fastfood` in a project folder. That's all! Fastfood updates local saved `Fastfile`s if needed and creates a new `Fastfile` in current project or updates an existing file. By default Fastfood clones files from [this](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/fastfile-test) repo, but you can change it via `--url` (or `-u`) option:

```bash
$ fastfood -u https://github.com/artemnovichkov/fastfile-test.git
```
Also you can select version of `Fastfile` via `--tag` (or `-t`) option:

```bash
$ fastfood -t 1.0
```
By default Fastfood updates last available version.

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended):
```bash
$ brew install artemnovichkov/projects/fastfood
```
### Carthage:
Create a `Cartfile` that lists the framework and run `carthage update`. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) to add the framework to your project.

```
github "artemnovichkov/Fastfood"
```
### Swift Package Manager:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Project",
    dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/artemnovichkov/fastfood.git", from: "1.0.0"),
        ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Project", dependencies: ["Fastfood"])
    ]
)
```
### Manually:
Drag `Sources` folder from [last release](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/fastfood/releases) into your project.
